# UPSTaRT
A repository for collaboration on UPSTaRT research project I am working on together with my classmate James Conolly.

Open-source contributions:

1. *A tool for identifying data bias*  
You can view this tool at: https://adamurban.shinyapps.io/Research/

And read more about the project at: [https://adamurban04.github.io/portfolio/jekyll/update/2024/05/19/upstart-summer-scholarship.html](https://adamurban04.github.io/portfolio/jekyll/update/2024/05/19/upstart-summer-scholarship.html)

Info:
- There are more R files. The whole code for the app is however in the app.R file.  
I split the whole code into multiple files for simplicity and workflow, however shinyapps.io only accepts apps in one file.  
- The www folder here on GitHub does not contain all the image files yet.
